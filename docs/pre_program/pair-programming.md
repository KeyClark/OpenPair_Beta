If you're not familiar with the basics of Pair Programming, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET3Q6zNK3Io).

Since you are working together remotely, you will use **Visual Studio Code** with the **LiveShare Plugin** for pair-programming (as mentioned in the [Pre-Start](pre-start.md) document).
