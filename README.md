## Manifesto

Using the included materials and guidance, experienced Software Developers and Engineers can work directly with emerging talent.

This program is ideally designed for mentees who have a basic grasp of the fundamental skills of a programming language, in this instance **Node** applications written in either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**.

The goal of this program is for mentees to have an experience working with a professional, improve the development of a personal project, and acquire a more pragmatic mindset and approach to developing software.

Every mentor will bring their own unique flavor to the progam by modifying, expanding, and organizing the program according to their strengths and interests.

> **OpenPair** was originally created to provide free peer-to-peer support for new developers who identify as *BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Woman (She/They/AFAB)*.
> 
>The target audience of this program can be co-opted to target any communities or individuals deemed appropriate by the host (mentor).
